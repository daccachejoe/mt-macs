### Study Description
This was a reprocessing of published single-cell RNA seqeuncing studies focused on myeloid cell populations 
We identified a population of metallothionein specific macrophages in this study, validate their presence in multiple studies and propose biological function/relevance via dowbstream analyses.

### Datasets studied
In this meta analysis, we obtained sequencing data from Geo GSE136103, Zenodo 10.5281/ze-243nodo.4059315, Geo GSE136831

### Analaysis workflow
In order to replicate this analysis, or just track our analytical path, please follow the following path of scripts
`pub-preprocessing.R` --> `pub-processing.R` --> `pub-myeloid-processing.R` --> `figures.Rmd`  
The corresponding data should be available in our GEO repository for processed data (GEO #).
